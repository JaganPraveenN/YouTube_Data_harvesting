Title: YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing Project

Description:

**Overview:**
This project aims to develop a simple yet robust system for harvesting and warehousing YouTube data. The goal is to collect relevant information from YouTube videos and channels, store it efficiently, and provide a structured dataset for further analysis.

**Key Features:**

1. **Data Harvesting:**
   - Utilize the YouTube API to retrieve information such as video details (title, description, views, likes, dislikes), channel details, and comments.
   - Implement a mechanism to handle API rate limits and ensure efficient data retrieval.

2. **Data Storage:**
   - Choose a suitable database system (e.g., MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB) to store the harvested data.
   - Design a schema that accommodates video and channel information, maintaining relationships between them.

3. **Scheduled Updates:**
   - Implement a scheduling mechanism to periodically update the dataset with fresh information from YouTube.
   - Ensure that updates are performed efficiently and do not violate YouTube API usage policies.

4. **Web Interface (Optional):**
   - Develop a basic web interface for users to query and visualize the stored data.
   - Allow users to filter and sort data based on various parameters, providing a user-friendly experience.

**Dependencies:**
- YouTube API: Utilize the YouTube Data API for accessing YouTube content.
- Database Connector: Choose an appropriate library or ORM for interacting with the selected database.
- Web Framework (Optional): If implementing a web interface, use a framework like Flask or Django.

**Getting Started:**
1. Acquire API Key: Obtain a YouTube API key to access the YouTube Data API.
2. Set up Database: Create the necessary tables or collections in the chosen database.
3. Configure Project: Set API key and database connection parameters in the project configuration.
4. Run Harvesting Script: Execute the script to start harvesting data from YouTube.
5. Explore Data: Use database querying or the web interface (if implemented) to explore the collected data.
